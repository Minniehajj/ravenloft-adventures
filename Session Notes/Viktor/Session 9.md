On the morning of the second day, we see convoys moving in our direction, seems like trading caravans from Borça, with noble house insignias on them.

The family insignias include, Boritsi, Ravencrest, and Andaas families.

We’ve arrived in Levkrest, the capital of Borça! We head to Felix’s old home, as Nuria and the rest of the group enter and take care of their business, while Victor stands outside, thinking it’s not his place. They find a bottle of Whiskey that Felix was gifted 4 years ago for helping a class of soldiers graduate. They find a sketched portrait from years ago, of a young man with a nervous smile, which says “Welcome to the Corps”.

We donate his standard issue gear to his fellow guard troop.

---

We see a shop called Arcane Antiquities, and another one titled Elixirs of Levkrest.

We meet a lady named Vivi Goldthread who gave Zurolga some formalwear

---

We leave Levkrest, and we hit the road as the land slopes downhill into almost endless forest, where the trees are rather large, similar to Redwoods and Sequoias.

Ember examines the trees and determines plantations with several farmsteads in the Northern sections of this area.

We find a child that claims that their mother and sibling are hurt, and we encounter a pitfall trap and a bear trap nested underneath it, lots of traps in this area.

They “the wolf people” guards keep an eye out for comers and goers in the area.

As we arrive close where the kid pointed as where their mother was. We get ambushed as Nuria and KK check on our wagons, a two-front assault

As a Large White Wolf with a sword in its mouth breaks into the clearing, and transforms into his human form.

> Now now, we’ve got some royal visitors in town, put down your weapons, Ah well now, welcome to Verbrek.
