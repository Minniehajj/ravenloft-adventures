As we continue traveling, the white trees become more widespread and sparse, and we see farmsteads producing white wheat and normal-looking corn. We also catch sight of humanoids working the fields.

We see a Borça trading company merchant caravan, full of white wheat and corn, with a company that trades in ore.

We flag them down, and we get the following info:

- The land is taking preparations for war
- Aerie is the name of the city to the North
- Seemingly a full military state
- Hard to get into the city unless you “know someone,” while metal is a commodity
- The white wheat is the “highest traded crop” this time of year, appears as normal wheat.

Ember speaks to an Ox and hears that there’s some people outside of town on spikes.

The white/dead grass does seem to satiate the oxen.

He leaves us with “once things get dark, people tend to disappear” and to keep our heads down and out of trouble.

He recommends an Inn called the “Feather and Talon.”

We continue onwards, and we encounter a large wall that surrounds a city. 15-20ft wall, and a wind blows upon us from the east. The daytime temp and nighttime temps are really different, high 40’s-low 50’s now, vs 60-70 during the day.

The city is called “Aerie”

We get a whiff of rotting flesh.

A large mass of undead emerges in the sunset light, and begins running towards us, and we do see some forces along the wall as, and we’re still 2 miles away from the city wall.

We rush towards the city and horns begin to sound as the alarm resounds around the city.

We manage to get into the city using the carriage, wall of force, and some panicked decision making.

The war here has been going on for decades, and we start to fight back against the horde , initiative!

After the battle, Zurolga sees an black armored individual in the air, riding a bat. Zurolga went to investigate and got dispelled, so… she fell into a crater.

We are introduced to a black armored individual with a scar, named Mikhail Drakov, who said he pulled his men away to “see what we could do.”

We regroup back in the city gates, and we introduce the rest of the party to Director of the Ministry of the Arcane, in Lekar, Falcovnia’s Capital, Mikhail Drakov, who also happens to be the same individual that sent Zurolga falling.

Mikhail has amber eyes.

Leader of Falkovnia is Vladimir Drakov, Mikhail’s father. Mikhail’s at the bottom of Falkovnia’s military.

We can continue in the morning with Mikhail, at his sister’s manor, Kara Likarevie Drakov.

When we get to the inn, we are advised to speak with the owner of the Feather and Talon, Gorst, using the code “Talira”.

As we enter Aerie proper, the entire city’s been propogandized with nationalistic logos and colors for Falkovnia, lots of essential business, while everything else seems like sole-purposed towards a war effort.

Most people in the tavern appear to be military or city essential workers. We see an old man, whom we introduce ourselves, and we say the code word as a falcon appears on his shoulder. Turns out, that’s the bird’s name.
