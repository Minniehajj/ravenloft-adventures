After the message was delivered to Lord Timothy (that someone was captured trying to capture the “sacrifice”. We are left to roam town ourselves.

We arrive at the Howling Moon tavern, where we buy a room and retire to talk.

We plan to use the sending stone attuned to Lucy to figure out who was captured. We hear back Lucy: You won’t get any information out of me, I’ve already lost Damien, I lost what’s important to me, where I saw the bird.

Victor goes out to gather information, learning of the “Great Bonfire” in the middle of the town, to celebrate the Blood Moon. Some nobles were not invited to the usual party at Silverclaw peak, and maybe that’s where the ritual could be happening. Victor looks for a map to Silverclaw Peak and finds it from a small general store.

The rest of the party overhears a conversation between some guards about them being sent to the Southern Forest outside of the city to look for “some weird squid things”.

Two hour walk from Rendezvous point to Silverclaw Peak, then an hour and a half to hike up it.

KK, Nuria, and Zurolga go into town to keep up appearances, while Ember and Victor wait with Damien at the rendezvous point, as we await Duskfall. Our plan is to go at Dusk, hoping to head the ritual off and take down Lord Timothy..

Ember finds the assassin rogue from the rafters spying on the three of us, and heads her off as she goes to report to Lord Timothy, taking her down solo! The time’s come for us to make our way to Silverclaw Peak, as we take an off the beaten path.

We make our way to the top, and see Lord Timothy with Kara, an unconscious Isabella, and a crucified and dead Lucy :(

Lord Timothy seemingly saw the spider as Ember and approaches, while the rest of us hide. Ember is on her way to pick up Damien and Zurolga.

KK, Nuria, and Victor attempt to distract Lord Timothy
