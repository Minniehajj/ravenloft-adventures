We depart to Krezk, escorting Lucy to meet up with Emil and Damien, whom are there with the reconstruction efforts.

Krezk was recently destroyed due to the Mongrelfolk rebellion. The abbot that formerly controlled the Mongrelfolk, and he was removed from power by the Heroes of Barovia, and the Mongrelfolk rebelled against the people of Krezk. Krezk’s former inhabitants have all fled, besides the werewolves that were hiding there before. The mongrelfolk were eventually wiped out, by the Argent Dawn.

The construction workers are heading to camp for the evening.

Emil plans on helping Damien with leadership skills, clearing his name, and installing him as the new leader, or deceive them into believing Damien is the new werewolf god returned.

We hear a shout, and we find Isabella knocked over, her wheelchair ajar, as she says there’s a collapsing sinkhole, and she says her brother’s inside.

We drop into the hole, and we seem to have found some catacombs that appear to have lots of spiderwebs around.

Initiative!

We crush this thing, rescue Damien, and some of the markings on this remind Viktor of a ghostwalk spider, but not exactly the same as this creature, but a humanoid amalgamation of this. Nuria finds an odd runic bronze ring on its body.

It seems like it was a leftover Mongrelperson.

We reunite Damien and Lucy, and Nuria attunes the ring, which turns out to be a Ring of Regeneration, which she gifts to Isabella and Damien, to help Isabella regrow her limbs.

Over the course of the next week, we train Damien and Lucy with various disciplines, to attempt to help him garner his favor with his people.

Then, we begin to plan our next move:

South of Verbrek, to the mountains and forests of crystal

West, tropical area with a desert beyond that

North, large sea of ivory white trees.

We decide to head North.

Ember recalls an old fairy tale, where someone who dies in a far off country, a white tree shows up in that land.

We arrive at the forest, the trees have no leaves, with barely living grass all around. The weather cools off a little bit, like late autumn. The trees seem like they’ve been dead for years, but somehow they’re not rotting.

KK attempts to cut in the bark, hears the scream of a human while cutting into it, and takes some psychic damage.

Ember casts Speak with Plants, and she hears what seems like a cacophony of voices, seems like voices lamenting their deaths or their presence here in the forest, regrets from its past life, with no regard for anyone communicating with them.

She attempts to speak with the grass, who says “they’re the souls of the land”, and then otherwise screams.
