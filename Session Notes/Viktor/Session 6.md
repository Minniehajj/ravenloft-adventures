Vorthrax, the Eternal Flame

---

We fight off the undead wyvern and race to the beach, where we engage the necromancer, known as Vorthrax, the Eternal Flame, aboard some beached ships. We fire a cannon at him, causing him to retreat, and the day is won! We level up to level 8, and start to make our way back to either Vallaki or Castle Ravenloft, licking our wounds and discussing the next step of our adventure
