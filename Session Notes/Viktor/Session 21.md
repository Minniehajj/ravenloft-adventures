We start our entrance exams in the competition, first beginning with a question, and answer in turn.

The question is “given facing down an enemy army, with your commanding officer and a dozen of your company down, what do you do? Use a spell of yours to either fight the enemy, retreat, or protect your friends, what do you do?”

We then encounter a student getting berated by some other students, led by a scion of a Holt family. We intervene, and an older professor with an ornate staff interrupts us. He mentioned a Professor Gerulf Dragan.

The student that was getting berated introduces herself as Noelle.

A crowd begins to form near the training area.

We see Kelbor near a signed training dummy.

The second test is “Professor Geralf’s Dragon”, casting a damaging spell on a training dummy in an arena.

Noelle’s last name is Bennet.

The third and final test is “The Arcane Labyrinth of Ever-changing Paths”

We’re all given a crystal ball before this trial.

The final gate in the maze is a riddle ”With word or hand, bend my command. Chains forged still stay, bound to what I relay, what spell am I?”

-Suggestion was the answer!

We do a duel between the two teams since we came in first and second, so initiative!
