We lay out some land mines the final night before the fated night, with Zurolga slightly lighting herself on fire. We sleep before the night before.

During Zurolgaâ€™s watch, she sees a green light out in the mist, and wakes Lord Reinhardt, who runs out to investigate. Issei raises the alarm, and the camp readies for battle!

Ships with wings begin to appear to be flying in from the mist, ships that appear to be gliders, floating a few feet above the water. One of these gliders quickly crashes into our tent, as boney monstrosities come surging out.
