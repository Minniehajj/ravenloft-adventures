The mage used Eldtrich Blast on Isabella to try to complete the ritual, and in a last ditch effort, KK threw a fireball out to try to light all of the blood on fire, and Lord Timothy howls in rage.

Victor turns Nuria into a Trex, who with the help of Ember’s Moonbeam, completely decimates Lord Timothy, and eats him alive. The race is now on to see if we can save Isabella and/or Lucy.

As the blood moon continues, the moon launches out beams out at us, absolutely burning all of us, and a figure appears from a singular light of the moon.

She’s the goddess of the hunt.

She says that due to there being no way of getting Timothy’s body or blood, we can no longer bestow the gift of the Fenrir, so we’re…. left on our own to deal with this issue.

We teleport back to our tower in Barovia. We rest, then arrive back at Castle Ravenloft, give our report, and Lord Reinhardt plans to take Damien and Isabella to Emil and decide what to do with the power vaccuum.

We travel to Borca to attempt to procure the fancy oils that we need to reincarnate Lucy.

WE LEVEL UP to 9 here
