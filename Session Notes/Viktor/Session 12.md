In the wake of the battle, we find a small book inscribed with a language of the outer planes, alongside a gallon of werewolf blood and behead one of the mind flayers as proof of what could be happening. Ideally, we distract Lord Timothy with this external threat and while his guard is down, we pounce. We arrive back at the city and attempt to walk towards Lord Timothy’s home.

We see Lord Timothy on his chair, ordering about people gathering for the ritual, alongside his wife, Kara. We also see a cloaked individual wearing purple and red, a large armored muscular man, and 3 older advisors.

Lord Timothy sends the advisors away, and we get a peak at the cloaked individual, who appears to be a tall woman dressed similarly to the smiling individual from Novavaasa in the mirror, an agent of Benedict Del Conti, and they are wearing a purple and red mask with a spiral going towards the face.

We somehow manage to convince him that the werewolf here is the remnants of his son, and he’s given us a reward of some sort.

We attempt to initiate combat, but the masked individual casts Silence and then smiles at us? Then holds up a note that says: “Traitor?” to KK.

We … don’t know what is happening, but we’re rolling initiative

Zurolga sends a message which gets responded with “I am the archbishop of death, and I need something before I leave, I can’t stand any interruptions.” so… not a friend.
