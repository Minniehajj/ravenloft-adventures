We stand triumphant over the undead, but Lord Reinhardt is unconcious.

Zurolga, and Victor run towards the shore, and see 4 small ships and 1 large ship pull up to the shoreline.

Ember and Nuria stay behind, guarding Issei, while the rest of us are running to the ships to see if we can do anything about them.

We’ve contacted General Argo, and we have orders to keep Issei safe, while the undead dragon and magic user are at large.

We encountered 3 large undead hulks and engaged in attacking them
