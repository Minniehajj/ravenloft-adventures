Kara gives us the Tome of Intelligence, which with the missing page, allows a +2 to INT when read. We rest for the evening then come back to rendezvous with Kara, learn what we can from her book.

We examine the record of executions and Kara points out that most of these from beyond the mists, of Borca, and the land to the North being cold, referred to as Darkon.

KK casts Detect Magic on the Writ of Drakov, and we get an element of illusory magic on it.

Kara opens the book, her eyes alight, and the pages flutter and then closes and locks again.

In the first two chapters, she learned that her father was a conqueror and a tyrant.

Vladimir is maybe as old as the land itself.

Sir Drog was related to the blacksmith family, located at a military stocking area called Silvervas.

We depart for Silvervas, and we encounter lots of military folk traveling on the road.

The old man who runs the storefront in Silvervas apparently has quit the trade, for a few months (lining up with the disappearance of Sir Drog).

The old man is in mourning for his missing (and now confirmed dead) son, and we reveal to him that we went into the tower and found his son’s remains.

As we speak, a massive black blade falls, almost hitting KK, embedding itself into the ground.

From centuries ago, there were stories told of these things, these weapons from a long-gone country, known as a Mercurial Greatsword. Zurolga grabs the sword, and she feels a sense of hunger.

We are gifted the sword, and he gives us an inn called The Shrouded Lantern.

We enjoy dinner, where Zurolga has x3 the same meal, evidently needing it to bulk up to wield the sword 🤺

We embark for Lekar the following day, passing tons of ruined towns and bunkers from undead assaults.

While we travel, Nuria opens the book with the raven insignia, and hears “I am the Land.”

Everyone besides Ember’s eyes begin to glow, and we get brought into a vision of two men sitting around a campfire.

One man has an extravagent cloak with a raven on it, and a large black sword at his side, pale skin.

A younger man, combed brown hair, neatly trimmed beard, a red robe and a wizard’s tome sitting at his side.

The wizard says “So you’re telling me, for like two centuries, you’ve been chasing the same reincarnation of a woman, this whole time?”

The pale skinned individual is Strahd, with the mage being the living version of that undead mage that we’ve encountered a few times now.

Strahd says “it’s been days since our experiment failed, but we did succeed in the mists disappearing, so I suppose your hypothesis was somewhat correct.”

The wizard says “Well of course it right, but I didn’t expect the side effects of where it throw us”

He continues, “so you… made a deal with one of the dark powers, do you ever regret it? Strahd begins to pace around the fire, looking into it and responds “The only thing I regret… is feeling like I’m stuck in a loop”

“I don’t regret my brother being dead, but I do regret never being able to be with the one I truly love.”

The wizard is… Azalin.

“And what of you Azalin? It matters not how many books you read, it seems like you never learn another spell” The wizard responds “I’m done with these damn planes, all they do is cause everyone within them to suffer. I’m stuck in a limbo, but I’m going to rip them all down. The dark powers have tortured me for centuries, and you, Strahd, even longer. But once I figure out how to bring them all to heel, I’ll be able to get out of this damn place.”

They look at each other then say “The plan is to see what’s going on out there with the mists gone, and try to get out of here before they get back”

The book is shut, but the clasp is shut tight for now.

On the second day, we once again open the book to see what we can learn, the next vision

---

Strahd is driving a carriage, with Azalin quizzing Strahd on spell components.

Strahd appears to be getting tutored by Azalin on spellcraft, working on the spell Animate Objects.

Strahd speaks: “So, is your mentoring me your way of attempting to repent your inability to learn new magic?”

Azalin drinks out of a flask, lazily looking at his spellbook, “Well you know what they say, two minds are better than one”

Strahd says “You don’t suppose you’d be able to animate multiple swords or halberds, to be more effective do you?

Azalin: “Anything is an object! But if you animate bones, does that make you a necromancer?”

Azalin: “Do you think the Vampyr that gave you your powers will let you out if you manage to get your fanes activated in Barovia? If you even can?”

Strahd: “I know I’m just ready to go home, if we have to travel through Tempest and these damned faeries, I’m going to lose my goddamn mind”

We arrive at Lekar, seeing a large castle at the top of the city, and a giant cathedral-like building with seemingly a large arena next to it, this is probably the mage’s college, and this city is overall giant.

Walls covered in skeletons. The city is very military-centric, very function over form.

We are given the Inn, The Steel Talon, a building seemingly made entirely of steel.

We see a denizen known with herardly from “The Grand Mechanicus” as Kelbor

The challenges:
