We get escorted by Lord Timothy along the main road, as we get a sort of … forcibly-guided tour of Verbrek’s lands. We see lots of workers, people working on various farming situations. We rescued the small family and sent them on their way to the Borça border, and Lord Timothy was not pleased, but kept us on our way.

Verbrek resembles a land within the 1600’s, with advanced agricultural techniques, windmills for grain, they are using crop rotation practices. Victor doesn’t seem to perceive any sort of unrest in the population, though surely there is some societal impacts.

After about an hour, we arrive at more settled areas, more city-like. We move past a very large wooden wall that weaves through the forest.

We see a sign that says “Welcome to Arkan Vale” - The name of the capital city of Verbrek.

There’s a very large “hunting lodge” esque building, on a hill overlooking everything else.

We halt on the road up to this lodge, as the men begin to unload from Lord Timothy’s wagon, with crates, some with the “clang of bottles.” Some markings of various merchant companies from Borça, though not Boritsi’s rose symbol.

We also see a younger, silver haired woman come out from the large cabin, as she rushes towards Lord Timothy, whom she kisses. She is introduced to us as “Kara”, Timothy’s wife.

She says this is a very tight knit societies, so if we aren’t openly “allies of Verbrek” it might be challenging to do anything without supervision.

We have about 3 days until the full moon (!!!).

Ember stumbles upon a passage in the book, Werewolves: Gods and Legends, about a powerful werewolf transformation, known as “the [[Fenrir]]”, a form that can be only gifted upon a single person, given from “The Lady of the Hunt”.

Fenrir, is currently gifted to Lord Timothy.

Something else noted in the book, known as the “Blood Moon”. Seems mostly that Verbrek is a mostly human society.

---

We enter the house for dinner, with a large finished wood decor, lots of decorative animal heads on display, as well as a Cockatrice.

We gift him a bottle of wine. He seems to be under the impression that Ember, KK, and Nuria work for Ivana Boritsi.

He asks after Lucy, who has heard reports that Lucy might be harboring a fugitive within Verbrek.

Evidently Lord Alfred Timothy’s son was stricken by a bout of madness, leading to the death of his former wife (through his eyes). He wants to bring his son home during the new moon.

His son, Damien Timothy, had a wave of rage, which caused him to attack things indiscriminately. This occurred about 5 years ago, so he’s around 19. Damien is a skilled hunter as well, and Lord Timothy has not been able to find him.

Reports from across the countryside depict Lucy and Damien being seen together. He.. wants to tie up loose ends, after this many years. Why the events occurred here, and what part his son took in events.

He wants us to find his son, maybe as a show of good will.

Most of the sightings of his son and Lucy were around the Southern Peninsula of his border. And he’s wanting to find his son prior to the full moon in 3-4 days, and they are having a festival at that time. This moon has a shade to it that comes around every 200 hours or so, and it’s a red moon. (A Blood Moon, according to the book).

Asking about the surroundings of Verbrek

To the West: A portside country Valachan

To the East: Borça

To the South: ??? - bordered by Sands.

To the Southeast: A heavily crystal forest area called Invidia

He’s giving us a “piece of the family’s line”, a pendant with a large tooth that has been carved to look like a wolf’s head.

There appears to be a shadowy figure keeping tabs on us in the back corner of the dining room.

---

Ember transforms into an owl, and stalks two individuals hiding and keeping tabs on eyes, one of whom has something on them that is golden.

The golden crossbow at the figure’s hip is “The Bard’s Parting Shot”, last known owner as Lucy Bennett.

The other individual appears to be moving around the perimeter of our guest house.

We get accosted by a cockatrice, defeat and carve it down for its meat.

We arrive at some really dense forest, and we hide our wagon at the edge of the forest, and move ahead on foot.

We arrive at the rendezvous point, and a spear flies past Victor, thrown by a large muscular man, who disappears into the forest. We begin to follow and he ambushes us, and we knock this person out, just as Lucy arrives, who notably has different colored eyes.

Turns out this person was who “Lucy has been trying to not not to get killed.”

Turns out, it’s Damien! Who thought we were hunters.
