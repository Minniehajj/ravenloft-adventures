We resolve our issues, and attend to Damien and Lucy’s camp.

As we catchup, she evidently has “forgotten” Felix due to the sacrifice of time he made, as if he almost never existed in this realm.

Lucy tells us that one of the lords here, the “Lady of the Hunt” - a patron deity of many hunters, and across those of the lycanthrope variety, and she’s a guardian of the balance of nature.

Damien says his father is likely trying a once/100 years method of ascending to Godhood.

Damien has a sibling, Isabella, who’d be between 12-13 now.

Evidently, Lord Alfred Timothy killed his wife, Damien’s mother, and an oracle said 5 years ago, that his son would inherit the power of Fenrir, via a ritual from the hunting pack.

There are crystal forests to the South of Verbrek, where elves live and evidently shoot at anyone trying to enter their territories.

Suddenly the fire in our camp turns blue, and erupts into ice and spears us, as some an armored wolf come running out of the woods to attack us

We vanquish the enemies, and KK rips the claws off of the werewolf.

Armored wolf is named “Garrick”.

We travel about a mile away with the body of the mage, with the intent of trying to interrogate the dead mage via Speak with Dead tomorrow.

Midway through our watch, KK encounters an… intellect devourer? He shooed it away. Victor wakes up and tracks that the monster took the leg NW.

Zurolga - The one who has the power of Fenrir has to bathe in the blood of their own kin during the blood moon.

The Intellect Devourer had eaten the mage’s brain.

Damien mentions that wererats had helped Damien stay alive, who are good hardworking farmfolk.

Our plan is now to investigate the intellect devourer, find and kill one, and bring it to Lord Timothy in hopes of distracting him with an external threat, during the Blood Moon ritual and get a jump on him at the time.

We find a two story house in the woods, at the end of the blood trail, and we start to hear like something being dragged.

We investigate the house, where opening the door gives us the stench of death, as if something has been dead in here for years.

Two dismembered men, that look like they’ve had their fluids drained from them, with large jugs sitting in house.

We find a hatch in the kitchen, leading down, and a stairs up the stairs.

We go up first, and the stairs are creaky, where we hear movement up, and get ambushed by a Mind Flayer!

KK fireballs the basement, and the first floor collapses, and we find a werewolf attached with a tap into the wall, still alive, and see jars full of blood???
