Ember interrogates a large “flock of (pigeon) familiars” who appear to be watching us, a total of 30 or so, and we get the following pieces of information: their master is a “her” and they are… tortureous.

We keep one of the pigeons behind, then the rest of the flock comes in to try to rescue them.

We dispel the flock and investigate what could be happening.

We’re going to try to stay neutral while we’re here, gathering information and doing mercenary work to get a lay of the land.

Zurolga casts Detect Evil and goes downstairs to the tavern, and two scents go off: 1 Undead and 1 Fey.

A young noblewoman gives off the undead vibe, who seems a little out of place, speaking to two young men at a table. She has amber eyes.

She’s speaking to two trade workers, and she left with them. We took Zurolga upstairs and fell asleep.

---

We get dressed in our nice clothing, and meet Mikhail outside, who proceeds to immediately flirt with Zurolga once again. He appears to be giving off normal body heat and does have longer teeth but not quite fanged.

We depart to Kara’s manor, inside a large carriage as we travel through the city.

Viktor notices the two men from last night sitting on the benches by the road, appearing exhausted. They look quite pale and but seem otherwise alive. They are dressed like they are getting ready for work. And we receive a map of the region, Falkovnia.

We arrive at the Manor, and see an older woman greeting Mikhail.

Mikhail appears to be getting called back to his duties, and he teleports away.

Kara says she just lives here in the city, she’s not a city official. She has a few servants in her household. Kara is looking for an old book here in the city, but first more information.

Falkovnia has been in constant war, with military rule essentially. The war has been against the undead for as long as they remember, but her father Vladimir says that there’s a land to the north that he’s been fighting for centuries now.

The undead around here seem to come from the mists, from all directions, but now they are coming from the East it seems. She’s heard vague stories of the mists going down before. And the undead appear every single night for as long as she’s known.

There’s one attack in their land, every night, never in a pattern, and they come from somewhere East, while their forever enemy is from the North.

In Aerie, the city was built around a long-lived library, now sealed, now haunted.

The Selberhas Aerie, a now haunted library, a large tower that sits in the middle of town, with no windows and appears to be made out of large stone. The tower is surrounded by a perimeter fence.

As compensation, we’d recieve a Tome of Intelligence, roughly about 5000 gold worth.

We could bypass the security with a Drakov brooch.

The name of the tome we’d be looking for is protected by a “Great Guardian”, and is sealed so that if its not opened correctly, it might destroy the contents, and no one she’s sent to get this book as returned.

Recently, a paladin and two mages went in a few months ago and have not been seen.

The name of the book is reference as the “Writ of Drakov”

The last time the book was seen was maybe 300~ years ago.

We explore the tower, and find a book called “Whispers of the Fell Land”, written in common.

KK sees two kids reading on the ground and say “you’re gonna be the new Hole man”, and the book they were reading is called “The Falcon’s Shadow.”.

- A military strategem describing Falkovnia’s military, failed campaigns, and rumored betrayals in the ranks of Falkovnia, it seems a few hundred years old.

KK goes to investigate where the kids went, and sees an armored skeleton with a hole in its chest behind the bookcase.

Zurolga casts “Speak with Dead” on the skeleton, and asks the following questions:

- Q: What killed you?
- A: All I saw was large red eye before I felt my soul leave my body
- Q: Why did you come here?
- A: I was looking for treasure and no one comes here, and I needed money
- Q: Did you come here with companions?
- A: I came with a friend who was a rogue, and I saw him lose both of his legs before we ran.
- Q: What happened before you saw the large red
- A: We snuck around, looked through old books, searched cabinets
- Q: Where is the “Writ of Drakov?”
- A: I do not know that book of which you speak, I was unable to find anything with that name, implying that he doesn’t what the book is.

We determined that it’s likely a Beholder that did this to them, with a Disintegration Ray perhaps, so perhaps no Wall of Force.

On the next floor, we see the skeleton of a small halfling with its legs missing, and a group of well preserved books.

We also see the withered corpse of a female adventurer with a hole in her side.

Among the books: “Rot and Ruin, a Farmer’s Almanac”, all of the rest of the books in this group appear to be related to farming in this land.

We see another female adventurer’s remains, that seem a little newer.

We come up with a plan: Vengeance as Ember’s familiar will scout ahead as a cat, and we’ll go up the stairs one at a time to avoid any line rays.

There are ten floors in this tower in total.

We recover 135 gold among the bodies.

We plan to attempt to leave the tower, one at a time, to even see if we can even leave. Nuria steps on a step, going down to the first floor, and then she disappears, and reappears again on the fifth floor stairs.

On the fifth floor, we see a very bright set of plate mail, with a hole blown through it, but right next to it is a large lump of flesh with multiple drooped stalks, with a sword sticking out of it, a 6 ft tall lump of flesh. The sword itself looks extremely shiny and well adorned, with gems and other things.

The lump appears to be dead, for a long while now.

On the body, we find a holy symbol of Helm, and a small heart-shaped locket. The armor also seems to be enchanted but somewhat damaged.

The locket contains a very detailed sketch of a man and a woman in portrait, and there appears to also be a second sketch with the same man and a different woman, also in portrait.

We then ask the corpse of the paladin:

- Q: What is your name
- A: Sir Drog de Montreval du Leonas
- Q: Who sent you here?
- A: Kara Drakov
- Q: Are there any other threats here besides the creature you killed with your last breath?
- A: This is the furthest my companions and I made, I was able to kill the creature
- Q: Where is the Writ of Drakov?
- A: I found a ledger, there is a vault at the top of the tower.
- Q: To whom do we send your personal affects for your untimely departure
- A: I have family in Lekar

We ascend to the seventh floor, which appears that it’s been set ablaze, completely torched.

We then ascend to the eight floor.

As Nuria takes her first step to the next floor, Viktor feels a grip on his foot and he gets pulled through the Ethereal plane down the sixth floor.

Vengeance sees a large vault door at the eight floor landing.

Where Viktor was, KK sees two spectral woman, both staring right next to Zurolga’s face
