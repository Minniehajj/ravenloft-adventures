Felix lets his life go, and we battled and defeated King Hajplaads. A new friend, Victor arrives from Barovia, in hopes of helping the party as Lord Reinhardt thinks they might need some help with things, considering it’s been a few days and there had been no communication. He’s a bard who plays a violin, wears dark clothing.

These notes, from now on, will be written from his perspective.

I’ve met up with the new friends, and we’ve decided to call ourselves the “Dreadkeepers” for now (working name)

We get to know one another a little, give Zurolga a debrief on Lord Reinhardt

We travel back to Barovia, being greeted by Helga.
