We encounter a child on the road, who turns out to be another undead agent that Zurolga takes care of.

We arrive in Levkrest, and we are directed to a Mr Von Di’s Lotions and Potions, who appears to be buying up oils like what we need for reincarnation.

We acquire the lotions, and an hour later, we hear screams in the crowd, and three of us get turned invisible, seemingly 30 feet radius around us, everything apparently becomes invisible. Nuria can sense with Blindsight and KK can see Invisibility via the cursed eye. This lasted about a minute.

Seemingly a side effect from a wild magic surge? Potentially.

Some of the bards were performing at the Academy of Style, where we take a detour and encounter a Tiefling bard playing a fiddle, wearing very unfamiliar looking garb (cowgirl outfit).

She says she’s from “Kartikas”, a small country that we haven’t heard of.

Lucy returns as a Glasyan Tiefling, and she described the afterlife as a large pile of gnashing teeth.
