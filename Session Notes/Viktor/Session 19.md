We have Vengeance investigate the 8th floor, and he finds a bank vault type door at the end of the hall. We manage a short rest, after KK hallucinates a worm infestation in his stomach 😫

We make our way to the 8th floor, where he hears “we’re gonna have our selves a new hole man”.

We find a sealed black book with a hole in the front, with a Raven insignia on the back.

The chest is locked, and trapped with an arcane lock that contains a Lightning Bolt, which Viktor disarms, and inside is a bone-white key with a skull embellished on it.

This key would fit into a small journal or diary.

KK detects a ward on the door, designed to sabotage the contents if the lock is tampered.

We find 2 more of these:

2nd Floor - Nothing

3rd Floor: The Falcon’s Shadow: Worn down: R-x, has the number 3 at the bottom

5th Floor: Farmer’s Almanac: L-2 Has the number 2

6th Floor: KK finds a mark in the executioner’s book, saying “R-55”. Has a Number 1.

We need a Sleight of Hand check to ascertain the missing number, and we prepare to find it.

The missing number is 42.

The door opens, as the room itself is pitch black, and Nuria enlightens the room, while a searing red light and a skeletal horde surges forward. Multiple small red orbs float around this creature, initiative!

We win! Barely!

We find a book with a keyhole to it, the Writ of Drakov!, and a glass-encased page. It appears to be the final page to a Tome of Intelligence?

We see whirling wisps of spirits rise up around us, including a small child, and the paladin and two mages, who says that returning his belongings will get us a reward of some sort. Then a large great green light appears as all of the spirits begin to be pulled up into the ceiling.

A very familiar green light, similar to the giant pillars of light from months ago.

We manage to depart the tower, and evidently it’s been 6 days.

As we leave, we hear from a flying pigeon “if only I had time to deal with you right now.” And we also hear “Come to Lekar so we can discuss your usefulness”

As we head toward Kara’s, we hear mumblings of “it’s gonna start, it’s gonna start!”

We start to hear this odd static noise, and see a large group of people gathering around a box, and see people beginning to take bets, and they seem quite excited, and the boxes appear to be transmute sound, and the boxes are called the “Lamordia Box”

“In just a few minutes we’ll be live in the Grand Arcane Arena,” advertising a magical duel.

Reginald Fizzlespark is the MC, and the advertised event is. Mikhail vs Patrina Vilkovna in a no holds-barred wizards duel.

Mikhail’s entirely academy could be on the line if he lost to Patrina, who is rumored to be marrying Vlad Drakov, Mikhail’s father.

The cohost is “Mordekai the Mystic.”

Seemingly Mikhail has lost the duel!

We hear from the Patrina: “Students, faculty and citizens of Falkovnia, tonight, history has been written in fire and starlight. When I stepped into this duel, I knew what was a stake. This was not a mere contest of strength or will. The terms were set and my victory is decree, and I am your new headmaster.” Cheers erupt

“For far too long, Falkovnia’s mages have been second to steel, being called supports, advisors, or worse, expendable. From this day forward, Falkovnia’s mages will be held in equal with our blades.”

“Too every student here, know this. You are not merely students, you are the future. Under my leadership, the academy will become a bastion of power and prestige. And finally, for those you fortunate enough to recieve an invitation. For tonight, we don’t celebrate a victory. We celebrate new victories.”
