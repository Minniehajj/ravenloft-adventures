We meet Lady Boritsi, as part of the merchant group.

She mentioned that Verbrek, the land to the west of Borca, has some disruption involved, burned towns, lost traders, etc.

We embarked back to the Vistani camp to spend the night, and the next morning begins.

Back in Argynvostholt, General Argo has returned! Just as the troops are ready to begin their march to the staging area in Vallaki for the upcoming battle.

We meet up with Lord Reinhardt.

We agree to be a scouting troop, to climb Mt Baratok, and see if we can scout ahead.

We climb the mountain, and at the top, we see a wall of mist at the bottom of the mountain, beyond a lake.

One of the ships by the lake is ruined by the phrase “Chult”.

- Chult is a place with big lizards?
