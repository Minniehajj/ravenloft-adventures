Noelle arrived here in this land after a few things happened at home, following Lucy after she left to go adventure, and she’s originally from Waterdeep. Noelle attempted to use magic to locate her.

We attempt to contact Lucy to check up on her, with a response of “attempting government establishment, things okay…. helped Damien gain favor”

We get ready for the evening’s festivities, and KK find a jug of Black Volturgeist, an extremely strong alcohol.

Our entrance robes from Falkovnia have a brooch on them signifying us as military personnel.

Patrina is offering the “extra credit blood drive” once every 2 weeks.

Falkovnia’s realm is overcast during the day, with no sun, and the moon is visible at in evening.

Patrina seems to know a bit about us and our group, she has veiled knowledge about our existing adventures.

The Lamordian contingent goes out for the evening, so Patrina invites the rest of us to dinner.

The magical types are looked down upon in Falkovnia, but Patrina vows to fix that.

KK meets Biggie Talls, the nickname of a 2nd year elven student, and a dwarven 2nd year student.

A mid-20’s lady and her friends ran into Viktor, with a small jar of dirt and a tattoo of a chicken’s foot, and sayin something about “Mama Yaga” . As they walk away, they say something like “do you think big sister is going to be able to make it here?”

KK and Viktor start rousing the music of the party.

We are summoned for dinner with Patrina.

Patrina has been watching Lord Timothy, as he started to begin his conquest to the North, and it turns out she’s been watching us for a long time.

A dark robed individual, the spellcaster that got away from our fight with Lord Timothy, served Lady Patrina something in a bottle, and she originally worked with Lord Timothy, but wanted to eventually sabotage him anyway, so things worked out for her in that way.

It seems she’s been trying to consolidate power in the North, starting in Falkovnia.

Lord Drakov has battled these undead for many years.

Falkovnia has always been run by the Drakov family, and it’s always been Lord Drakov.

Patrina proposes an alliance:

- We must find out what happens to be resting at the Amber Temple
    - To learn more about Lord Reinhardt’s powers there, and what he could be hiding.
- We must kill Lord Vlad Drakov _after_ their wedding
    - In 1 week from now is their wedding

She claims that Lord Reinhardt could be someone else’s pawn, one of the other Dark Powers, maybe a power similar to Azalin Rex’s, playing by different rules, trying to gain power in the Amber Temple.

There are powers within this temple that others have gained gifts from, but they are purposely locked away because they are inherently evil in nature.

Elder members of the military here are of the vampiric variety, and Patrina is trying to work within the mortal and vampire society.

There’s a teleportation circle in the school, that we can use if we’re doing it in the evening.

The plan: following night, we’ll drop Noelle off at Verbrek with Lucy, then head to the Amber Temple afterwards.
