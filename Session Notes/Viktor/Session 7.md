Army begins to move towards Vallaki, up (and subsequently down) Mt. Baratok

Members of the army begin to talk about their plans once they get back home.

The cold gets worse and worse.

We’re around the campfire, learning a lot about Ireena and the rest of our companion’s backgrounds: Klingsklan is from Baldur’s Gate, but was originally born elsewhere

Nuria is from Neverwinter, where the plants are immaculate all year round.

Victor wanders off to speak w/ Lord Reinhardt, who he overhears suggesting to Jorien that their two armies join forces and integrate their troops to further work together.

Jorien asks if this is an intent for an occupation, and Issei laughs and says absolutely not, it’d be mutually assured destruction at that point.

Issei seems to have earned Jorien’s respect and says they can begin to share their forces amongst each other.

Argo analyzes that their current weakpoints are to the South and North of Barovia, as Novavaasa is mostly safe, aside from some dangers from the sea, East of Novavaasa, where they can’t fish farther than a mile or two out. Due to the army of the dead, they haven’t explored much North of their land.

We navigate to the Blue Water Inn, where we hope to gain some more information about how to best fight werefolk.

Danika tells me that moon-based spells are best used against them, and those more experienced can transform at-will, and those of the wolfish variety are vulnerable to silver.

Emil’s group has been traveling around Barovia since he became the new chieftain of the werewolves that are here. She also informs me that Krezk was nearly burnt to the ground, as of a few weeks ago.

The Mongrelfolk fought against those in Krezk and it turned into all-out war, and the city almost burnt to the ground.

Lycanthropy: Contracted via bite, cured via a tincture created from Silverleaf and Wolfsbane, fed to the patient during the full moon with a Restoration spell cast during it.

Issei owes us money! Zurolga says goodbye to Jorien as she’ll continue to travel with us.

We “fast travel” to Castle Ravenloft to have dinner with Issei, catching up and getting our rewards (in theory) for the last adventure.

As we relax, Nuria decides that she wants to duel Zurolga, DUEL IN THE COURTYARD!

We got 40 platinum each!

During dinner, Ireena mentions (quietly) that she wants to speak to Lord Reinhardt privately.

Victor makes Nuria invisible to go and spy on them.

Ireena: “Ever since you brought me back after the battle, I’ve felt like I’ve owed you everything. After you found me dead before, Ezmerelda told me you tore the Castle apart looking for how Strahd controlled the Dark Powers, and she said you found that scroll. You saved me that day, and you gave me a whole new lease on life, without having to worry about constantly looking over my shoulder, first time I’ve had peace for what feels like centuries, and I have to ask… why?”

Issei: “I don’t really know much I really believe in how your curse was to put you through the torture of being chased by Strahd over all of your lives, but when that vampire finally died, I felt like if I didn’t give you a chance to live your life in freedom, I’d have failed my promise to you when we first met; that I’d protect you. If I didn’t do that, I’d be betraying my oath. But now? I couldn’t be happier that I followed my word.”

Ireena: “I would say, I owe my life to you…. So can you tell me what I am to you?”

Issei: “Ireena, I have a confession. You know what, I can’t walk away from it. I traded my loyalty to in exchange for helping our country. It was… a steep price to pay and I couldn’t be any more sorry for you.”

Ireena: Begins to tear up, “I know. But I also know that what you didn’t wasn’t easy. Don’t hate her for it, but Helga told me how long you stayed by yourself, just wallowing in despair after the deal you made and what happened.” Ireena laughs a little, and then continues, “you were also on death’s door, so you probably had that coming. But I’ve forgiven you”

Issei: Dips his head a little, takes a deep breath

Ireena: “But in a way, if you think about it, I also just saved you, so don’t you think you owe me your life too?”

Issei: “Well, if you say it that way”

Ireena: “I never want anyone else to come between us”

Issei: Gulps a little

Ireena: “Since we both owe our lives to each other, Issei Reinhardt, will you just marry me?”
