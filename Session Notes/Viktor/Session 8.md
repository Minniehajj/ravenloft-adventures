After the proposal, Issei’s face just turns blank, and it seems like he’s processing the information, then he suddenly starts chuckling, as Ireena’s face suddenly turns deep red. Issei appears to be laughing at the irony of the situation? He accepts!

Nuria, invisible, overhears all of this, and turns to the door and knocks on it, in an attempt to get someone to open the door so she can slink out, and she manages to do so.

The next day, we are greeted at the table by a taller woman, long black hair and the traits of the Vistani, who introduces herself as Ezmerelda (She’s alive?!?). She hands us a brooch which allow us to teleport to/from the Watchtower and Ravenloft Castle.

We arrive at Van Richten’s Tower, with 4 floors, a kitchen area, a large sprawling library, 3rd floor with 6 different living quarters, including an invisible room within the tower that contains a shower.

We go over the current situation, and Patrina Vilkovna, from the missive found in Castle Fairhaven, is a name that Victor recognizes, who is the sister of Kazimir Vilkovna, former leader of the Vistani. She was rescued by the heroes, but she seems to have gone off to a different land,

[[Session Notes/Felix/Session 9]]

Benedict Del Conti is the second-in-command agent of Lord Azalin Rex.

We revisit the castle to relay the message from Castle Fairhaven, and inform Lord Reinhardt, and we ask him to inform us about who Patrina is.

He takes us up to his office, and sits us down.

“I am relatively very worried about this development.”

Kazimir made Issei promise that that the old party would save Kazimir’s sister no matter what.

Turns out, Patrina was one of the strongest wizards to ever be born in Barovia. And she was never truly a spawn. Issei grabs a book with the name “Rahadin” on it.

> The story goes, is that Patrina wanted more power, and the only way to obtain more power was to go through the Rite of Vampirism through Strahd von Zarovich.  
> However, the Vistani were ordered by Kazimir to try to stop her, and she was stoned to death by her own people to keep her from becoming another bride of Strahd’s. One of Strahd’s old comrades, Rahadin, punished the dusk elves on Strahd’s behalf by murdering all of their woman and children.

Kazimir, feeling guilty about this, asked the heroes to bring her back, and she was resurrected by the heroes. After coming back to the world of the living, attempted to seduce Issei with power, and there was a disagreement, a small battle, and then she disappeared.

We head back to the tower, and get ready for our trip, finding a few books about combating vampires, and a book with a wolf etched into the cover, written in Druidic, and called “Werewolves: Gods and Legends”

We encounter two rather large undead hulks, chasing a poor person in the wilderness

We vanquish the hulks and the dropped skeletons, and we introduce ourselves to this new individual, who introduces himself as “Eldric Vardus.” He claims he’s a traveler, who ran into this undead “seemingly from out of nowhere”. He was just leaving Levkrest and then to head North. He’s out doing research to try to find out as much as he can about the Nine Hells. Victor shakes his hand and casts Dispel Magic, and…. Eldric fades away into a skeleton. Turns out he was trying to lure the undead towards us in hopes that we would rescue him, to “test our morality”.

The question he presents us “can the leaders of the nine hells be considered just or evil for their role in the punishing of the wicked, even if some innocents are also subjected to the torment in their domain? Does the pursuit of the cosmic order of justice justify the suffereing of the inflicted or does the indiscriminate nature of punishment reveal a deeper moral ambiguity within their governance?”

As the conversation continue, he says to Zurolga “I sense you already have the touch of one of the devils of this place”. He seems to bring up that “Will”, the individual who gave back the group’s time as a “devil”.

He claims that this land is like its own hell, designed to torture its own individuals, and how we feel about it, and if it could change for the better if it could. He was using the Nine Hells as a metaphor for the Domains of Dread.

He says “he’s pleased with the response” and dissapates into dust… was this Azalin Rex?
