We agreed to launch a side assault on the mountain, with taking a small squad of soldiers under Zurolga, who sends two older… not too bright orcs with us, Groam and Thak.

We travel along with the Supply Line towards the front lines, but 5 hours in, a bridge appears to have smoke appearing from it, with the main bridge to Castle Fairhaven.

We were able to convert one of the wagons into a loose resemblance of boats

We notice that the undead armies have trebechets that are sending their soldiers in via… trebuchet balls.

Zurolga says that they are very vulnerable to positive damage, usually well armoured, maybe bludgeoning is more effective than others.

As evening starts, a large screech sounds towards the mountain, as a large winged creature gets lit on fire and crashes into the mountain by a small brown dot, also flying.

The dot is heading back towards the castle.

The winged creature was slightly larger than a horse - turns out it was a large Dire bat, that’s super dead, it had saddle markings on it.

A bird of prey, an eagle of falcon with a crown on its head was the insignia found on the satchel of whomever was riding the bat.

There are papers and a sextant with this individual’s belongings. The papers have a series of numbers on it, there’s 5 sets of coordinates on it:

- Kantora
- Vallaki
- Levkrest
- Unknown NE
- Unknown NW

Also, a letter:

> Under the orders of the new soon-to-be queen of Falcovnia, Patrina Drakov Vilkovna, search out the capitals of the near by lands.

The rest of the letter is too burnt too see.

The next day, we traversed into the mountain pass, and encountered an ethereal being that is armoured and has horns! There’s also something in the shadows directly above us, circling us
