Klingsklan is auditioning for “_The Enchanted Masquerade_” which is a love story about a young girl attempting to get into a high society party, attempting to win the love of the masked prince

Nuria and Ireena go to the crowd to watch tryouts

The rest of us have been trying to track for Adrian, and we’re told Adrian took an early day home today, and we tracked him to…. the The Talking Hand, which Felix has seen one day, though was drunk halfway through.

We regroup at the Theatre, where I recognize a few theatre community folk.

There’s a back entrance with a large steel locked door, embedded into the door, there’s some people behind it talking to one another, a distorted (intentionally) male voice mention:

> After last night, the kingpin seems to think it might be wise to bring out his new creation, and take it out on Miss Boritisi. After you idiots seem to have fucked up last night’s event. I will be back this evening

The door opens, revealing a blue robed individual with a silver plague doctor mask. This individual notices Nuria, then turns their hand, a shimmer appears and the figure steps into the shimmer and disappears.

This shimmer was a dimension door spell, so they teleported out.

Lucy overhears the following conversation from within a room under the stage:

> That cunt just thinks that because he’s the second son, he can order us around like the Kingpin

The mysterious individual is Brand Dillsnya

Is Brand Dillsnya = Adrian Vonz?

Ireena landed the lead for _The Enchanted Masquerade,_ so we’re acting as her entourage.

We head backstage, Ember casts _Obscuring Mist_ and we attempt to infiltrate underneath the stage, there’s a voice on the otherside, and I bust the door open…

Initiative vs Masked Dude (Brand? Adrian?)

Ember

Lucy

Brand

Klingsklan

Ireena

Nuria

Felix

This individual is in fact Brand Dillsnya, never recall a face captured or shown, the only feature is the mask, they were always close to Dion, they are both sons of Ivan

Their AC is 23, they like fire, and don’t like ice very much

Yep, he’s Adrian!

I manage to slice off his hand and Klingsklan finishes Brand off, who says with his dying breath

> “You’ll be lucky if he’s gone”

He had 3 Vials of Fireball that require an acrobatics check, basic Reflex save or take 4d6
