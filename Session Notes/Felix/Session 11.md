We attempted to get through the ramparts area, but were discovered by some skeleton guards.

Thrak accidentally set off a grenade of some sort, causing the walls to start to collapse, so we ran into the doorway after defeating some of the guards, and ended up navigating through the castle until we arrived in a room, ending up face-to-face with one of the other undead “Champions”.

We managed to defeat her, but were ambushed with two more.

We managed to vanquish them as well, but evidently we… “completed the ritual?” And a one eyed monster appeared to rise from the corpse of the defeated Dragonborn barbarian.

The journey continues…
