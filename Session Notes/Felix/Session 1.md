Gold and white carriage pulled by horses holding Countess Ivana Boritsi

[[Ivana Boritsi - WIP]] holding an intricate staff, nothing like anything we’ve seen before

Boritsi’s Staff with multiple spinning cylinders, brown wooden, with each cyllinder having multiple vials floating around them.

Boritsi has blue vials on her belt as well

She throws a vial off of her belt, with a bunch of bubbles that help put out the fires

We each get 3 blue vials

Camilla reports to Ivana as follows:

drug explosion in the sewer that set off this chain of events

Mentions of the name “Ivan”

“I believe we’ve lost several members of the expeditions from Barovia”

“Prepare for accusations from Barovia”

Ivana complains about the insurance here costing her a fortune

Ivana wants to meet with us all in the morning

The party stays at the Bloated Goat Inn, minus Felix, who stays in his small apartment

The party recovers, heads to the Ivory Tower first thing in the morning

Ember overhears two men speaking about thousands of gold, something will cost 12000 gold

Ivana calls us in after getting angry at the old men

Ivana offers us a job: Find the whereabouts of Ivan Dilisnya, bring her his head

If we get rid of the drug problem and get rid of Ivan, Ivana’s power would be absolute

We’ve got an invite to Ivana’s party, two nights from now.
