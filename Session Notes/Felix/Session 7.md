Lord Reinhardt seems to be doing a bit better, and has arranged a full treaty with Boritsi.

The land of Novavaasa (to the East) appears to be under a war of some sort, according to Lord Reinhardt’s scouts, with a large contingent of Undead approaching from the Northeast.

The Novavaasan troops appear to be a formidable group of Orcish warriors.

Lord Reinhardt would like us to consider an approach that helps us get more warriors.

Emil and a few other werewolf warriors have conscripted and are assisting.

There has been word from the Borcian merchants of the werewolves coming across towns to the North of Verbrek, a land called Ritchemulot.

Issei thinks there’s a chance that Lord Timothy has begun an invasion, a conquering effort from his land into others.

To the South, there’s a mountain range, past which is a long stretch of Forest, after which there is a large Desert.

To the North, there stands Mt. Baratok, where stands a Lake Shrouded in mist, which is one of the few areas that remain shrouded.

The Novavaasian’s are a proud warrior people that don’t want to leave their homeland and are in the process of defending their folk.

If Lord Alfred presents a problem, how can we assimilate their forces with Issei’s?

Maybe a new Alpha?

In Vallaki, there exists a smith that should be able to get us options against werewolves.

Arabelle’s eyes start to get a luminscent glow.

Through the door, a mist approaches as Helga appears.

Helga pulls out a deck of cards and places it in Arabelle’s hands.

She begins to shuffle and says:

> “I can see them, I can see them moving. Over the mountains, they come. Through the mist, they emerge. The forces are large, and they have many giants among them.”

She begins to lay out the cards

> “They will come, in 1, in 3, in 7, in 13 days they will be here”

She begins to lay out the cards, grabs a knife, and caves onto the table

She carves a map onto the table, appearing like a Map to Barovia, revealing the lake of Mist to the North of Barovia.

> “They’ll approach us from the lake. I can see Vallaki burning”

Her eyes return to normal, she drops the knife, and her hands are shaking.

Father Lucian has left Barovia, heading to Borça to teach them how to harvest Moonsickle and Wolfsbane.

The army appears to be made of armoured zombies and giants.

We’re deciding to head to Novavaasa, hoping to help them fight off the undead horde and trying to do an “enemy of an enemy” thing, as that will likely be faster than attempting to be diplomatic/subterfuge with Lord Alfred Timothy.

We depart with 6 bottles of Dragon Crush.

We head East, through the burnt village of Barovia and into the road East.

The Svalich Woods gives way to a large open plain.

It begins to rain, and a shadow approaches us from the side of our direction, and it’s coming from the North, it’s approaching at the speed of 160 feet/6 seconds.

It’s a skeletal rider! Initiative!

The rider vanquished, had an insignia with two broadswords and a crown on it, an insignia that eludes us.

We’ve stumbled upon the edge of some mountains bordering the plains.

We rest, and ride towards a town at the end of the road we’re currently in.

We hear clanging of armor and steel, and shouting.

They appear to be orcs running around the city cheering, and a cadre of orc warriors fighting off a skeleton horde…. Initiative!

Kantora is the city here in Novavaasa!

There’s apparently a “Fist Queen”, the Warchief

The Undead coming from “Castle Fairhaven”

Apparently the Orcs have been fighting the boney boyz for the past few years
