Kantora is mostly made up of orcs, half orcs, and humans , with “Scandanavian” inspired architecture

“Gorruk’s Grog and Grub” - Tavern/Inn

Seats are mostly filled already, with orcs laughing and talking.

Things have been busy the past few days with soldiers.

Randy and Gorruk are the proprietors of the tavern

Warchief Jotunheim, the “Fight Queen”

We should talk to the Captain of the Guard, “Roruk Steelclan”

Issues with some “spelly types”

Years ago, there were individuals from the East, who were good friends of Jotunheim.

They went to investigate the undead and went missing near Caste Fairhaven.

1.5 days East from here is the fishing town of Urgetus

The front lines are being harried by shielded skeletons. Also, they had an ally that’s a giant “rat” that throws spells and such.

The past few weeks, the undead have seemed to redouble their attacks.

We go to bed, and Lucy attempts to leave.

Lucy leaves! A half-orc with a blond mohawk with a huge sword, with half plate armor, ornate but well worn, not sure if it’s red.

Zurolga!

Many orc warriors attempted to charge a hill, getting blown back by multiple rays of energy.

Zurolga welcomes us to Kantora by dueling our “best fighter”, Klingsklan (She wins)

Kantora’s society is a secular one, relying on a diety known as “The Waa”

The Fight Queen is found in the boxing arena, training. (She’s a monk)

“Højplaads’s invading y’all too?”

Centuries ago, King Zaanji Højplaads was a human king that wanted to reign absolute war against all orc kind, but he’s apparently come back from the dead to do it all again.

The King took her old friends, killed them, and had them come back as undead.

The five friends:

- Helen - Warlock Fairly quiet, dark minded individual with a cat that tore up a bunch of furniture
    - Be careful of her spells
- Sakara - Dragonborn barbarian that could cleave most of her enemies in two
    - Super strong Rage
- Beatrice - A Giant Hamster Wizard
    - Fire?
- Dez’n Uts - Kobold Necromancer Cleric
    - Reanimates/heals dead
- Edgar - Tiefling Warror
    - Were able to push any battlefield forward

The undead have the high ground, with archers and ballista.
