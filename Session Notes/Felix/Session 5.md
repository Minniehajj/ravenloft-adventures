We deal a fatal blow to Adrian/Brand and I grab the remnants of his plague mask.

We follow the sewers into a large room, with music playing out of it.

Within the room, an individual sits with gloves, swirling a glass of wine.

There’s a music box in the corner, playing a record

> “It seems since it is you all entering my domain, then it means my poor boy is no longer with us”

The man’s hat is tipped down, wearing a fine tailored suit and a golden scarf around their neck, with a fine tailored vest.

> “And I suppose that you are here from my dear family Ivana, to put an end to me. That is a pity… I believe we could’ve worked together to help take down the heinous bitch I call family. You’ve been a thorn in my side for a too long”

They’ve evidently been at their throats since Ivana took power. They received two separate curses from ‘the powers above’.

Ivana was cursed to be young and beautiful forever, but with a body poisonous, she could never love anyone.

Ivan, also blessed with an eternal body, but still continues to age normally. He’s able to have family, but not able to be as strong as he once was. Through the use of his strings, he’s able to continue to live a mostly normal life.

They were both cursed by a deal Ivana made. Ivana’s family used to be doctors. They gave out assistance at no cost, and they planned for their son to take over as head of the family business.

Ivan planned with to partner with Ivana’s brother in the apothecary business. However, Ivana was always one to seek power. She was unhappy with her family’s decision to let her brother take over. Ivana, then… removed the family.

Ivan came on to Ivana’s plan, and tried to stop her. However, he was unable to stop the plan from going through, and killed all of her family except Ivan. The source of the curse? Unknown “higher powers”

The individual is a puppet, and as he finishes his speech, he gets strung up into the air and a giant mechanical golem charges into the room

Ivan

We manage to vanquish Ivan, beheading him and escape through the sewers back into town, getting us out through the slums.

We head through town, manuever back to the Ivory Tower. As we move, we hear musings of a faint earthquake and smoke occurring in the Theatre.

We drop Ivan’s head in front of Ivana, who’s hands begin to shake and a gleam comes to her eyes. As she holds the head in her hands.

> “I almost thought I’d never see the day, that he was finally dead”

She sets the head down at her desk.

> “Thanks to all of you, now that Ivan is dead. I now finally feel as though I’m a complete person”

A dark blue light begins to shine out from her suit, as she reels back in pain from her left side. She buckles over in pain, and a tattoo begins to appear on her lower left side. The tattoo is in the shape of a fox.

An energy begins to swirl around Ivana, and then dissipates.

Fox’s are referred to as sneaky, possibly greedy.
