We defeat this entity with great effort, getting absorbed and having it almost kill us all.

KK attaches the leftover eye to himself, absorbing some additional fun powers.

We managed to get aground, shooting a Ballista arrow at the gate winch, which lowers the gate and lights it on fire.

As we retreat, a golden winged cannonball blasts into the keep, and a new friend emerges, the Fight Queen! She’s joined us, with her arm broken.

We take a moment to try to find a place to rest.

We encounter two suits of armor on the 5th floor, who speak the following riddle: ”I soar through the stormy skies, I am feared by foes with weary eyes. I shred through foes with talons, what am I?”

> A blue dragon

A black sun insignia lies on a large door behind it.

We… swing the door open, and the room is pitch black.

Torches light up, and a figure wearing golden armor greets us at the end of the room.

Hajplads claims that the orcs were an invading force to Novavaasa, and he took over the form of undeath in an attempt to fight off the orc army, and he fell in a battle a long time ago.

He turned to undeath in an effort to fight off the orcs. He offered to talk and try to convince us to fight off the orcs instead, but…

We won’t take assitance from undead forces, so let’s fight!

He summons a gigantic ghostly skeleton thing with a gigantic sword, and we fight.

Haajplads + the Azure King vs us

We all fall…

But somehow, we all wake up in a void, to a clockwork being named…”Will”

We’re in Will’s domain, within… this domain?

He seems to need us to do something. He… seems to like us? We’re evidently helping someone he’s Chosen, and he says we’re maybe a good chance for him somewhere down the road.

We have to sacrifice one of our “remaining timelines” to have a chance at rewinding the cllock and healing up to take down Haajplads and the Azure King…

Who will give up their remaining years?
