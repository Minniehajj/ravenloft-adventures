Fox’s Sin of Cunning unlocked, +1 to all Diplomacy Checks

Ivana seems very puzzled about the tattoo, we relay that something similar happened to Issei Reinhardt, where his was a lion crest on his shoulder.

She bade us farewell and we go and rest.

We make our way to the Ivory Tower in the morning, as Ivana instructed to discuss our recompense.

Ivana is much happier today, and plans to set out personally to discuss an alliance between Borça and Barovia.

We’re offered honorary citizenship, allowing each of us to purchase property within Levkrest, given that we have the available funds, we could are allowed property within the nobility district.

She requested Felix take up the mantle of the captain of the guard, but Felix declines, wanting instead to continue traveling with these folks, on the conditions that a) Felix always acts with the interest of Borça, and b) if she calls upon him in need, he must answer

She also presents us with a chest, which contains a bag, a _Moderate Bag of Holding,_ as well as 300 gold coins.

She finally wants us to investigate what is going on to the West, and find out what Lord Alfred Timothy is planning.

Some of her merchants mentioned that she sees the remnants of burnt towns and citizens murdered in their homes, to the NW of Borça.

Apparently she… has a gift that let’s her see through people when they are lying to her.

She can usually tell when someone is trying to ruin her, and she wants us to investigate if he’s responsible for these attacks.

Lord Timothy calls himself “The Grand Lord of Verbrek”, and he did mention that he was going to soon take more land under his “protection”

We try to get her to take Ireena with her to her meeting with Issei

She thinks about it, but places an envelope on the table.

> “This will get you in touch with the master craftsmen in Levkrest, where they can get together and create one weapon of your choosing”

Felix tells Ivana of Adrian’s betrayal, and evidently she had a bet with Camilla on Adrian’s betrayal.

We get 4 days of downtime, during which we develop our weapons, earn some money, and Ireena practices for her play with Klingsklan’s help.

The play goes well, Klingsklan fills in for the lead actor.

We leave Levkrest, intending to deliver Ireena back to Castle Ravenloft

As we arrive at the Castle Ravenloft, a gauntlet bearing maid arrives to greet us, and she looks furious, beelining toward Ireena, ripping into Ireena for being gone for so long.

Evidently Lord Reinhardt has been sick for a few days now.
