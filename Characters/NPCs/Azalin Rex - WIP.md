## 🧭 Overview

Azalin Rex was once the dreaded Dreadlord of [[Darkon]], a vast and cold domain ruled by intellect, necromancy, and control. A former archmage of Oerth (Greyhawk), he sought forbidden knowledge beyond the veil of mortality. In undeath, he found power—but not freedom. Like all Dreadlords, he was bound to his domain, forced to rule in perpetuity under the watchful eye of the [[Dark Powers]].

Following the fall of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and the weakening of the Mists, Azalin vanished. Some claim his soul shattered in a ritual gone wrong. Others say he escaped—slipping through the cracks in the Mists to enact a new plan. His armies—both living and dead—have begun to appear across the Dread Realms, testing defenses, gathering artifacts, and corrupting the balance.

## 🛠 Role in the Campaign

Azalin Rex has emerged as the **primary antagonist** of the current era, aiming to usurp control over multiple domains. The party [[COUP]] is traveling between realms, gathering allies and unraveling his schemes before he achieves dominion—or escape.

Known associations:

- **Darkon** is in collapse, its people scattered and desperate. Some still follow Azalin fanatically.
- **Falkovnia** is on alert, fearing that Vladimir Drakov may fall under Azalin’s sway—or become his next conquest.
- **Borça** and **Nova Vaasa** have seen undead activity increase—some of which may be agents of Azalin, others opportunists.
- **Verbrek** experienced rituals tied to necrotic power—possibly intersecting with Azalin’s greater aims.

## 👁️ Philosophy

Azalin does not crave chaos—he seeks **order through undeath**. The living are fragile, emotional, and rebellious. The dead are eternal, obedient, and rational. In his vision, the **Domains of Dread** are a prison not only for him—but for all—and he alone has the mind to break the locks.

He views other Dreadlords (and even the [[Dark Powers]]) as flawed architects of a failed system. To Azalin, this is no longer about rulership—it is about **redesigning reality**.
