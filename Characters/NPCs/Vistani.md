## 🧭 Overview

The **Vistani** are a nomadic people known for their colorful wagons, haunting music, and supernatural connection to the [[Mists]] of Ravenloft. Long feared and misunderstood, they serve as guides, storytellers, and traders across the [[Domains of Dread]].

For centuries, they were considered allies—if not servants—of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], granted the ability to freely come and go from [[Barovia]] while others remained trapped. Since his fall, they have been reasserting their independence, redefining their place in a changing world.

The Vistani are more than a convenient narrative device—they are a **people** with deep traditions, mysterious powers, and a complex relationship with the dark forces that shape the realms they travel.

## 🪄 Cultural Traditions

- **Misty Passage** – The Vistani can traverse the [[Mists]] safely, making them invaluable couriers and guides between domains.
- **Prophecy and Dream Reading** – Through **tarokka cards**, dreams, and omens, they divine hints of fate—though not always clearly.
- **Music and Memory** – Bards and musicians among them carry ancestral songs passed down through oral tradition.
- **The Code of the Road** – All Vistani are bound by a shared sense of **hospitality**, **secrecy**, and **noninterference** unless called by fate or favor.

## 🛠 Role in the Campaign

The Vistani are now unmoored from Strahd’s shadow. Some remain in Barovia, seeking a new path under [[Issei Reinhardt]]. Others wander far, exploring domains they once feared.

Vistani have acted as:

- **Mentors** (as with [[Kastia]] and [[Viktor Vallakovich]])
- **Allies of the Old World** (helping or hindering travelers based on honor-debts)
- **Keepers of Secrets** (including lore of [[The Dark Powers]] and [[The Mists]])

Their actions are not governed by good or evil—but by loyalty, custom, and the pull of prophecy.
