## 🧭 Overview

Benedict Del Conti is a shadowy figure whose name has begun to surface in whispers across several Domains. Always just out of reach, he operates through proxies, forged documents, and mysterious messages left behind after pivotal events.

Wherever there is a power vacuum, a cursed ritual, or a fragile political alliance—Benedict has left his mark.

## 🕯 Notable Involvement

- **Verbrek**: Benedict's agents were spotted near **Silverclaw Peak**, attempting to redirect or sabotage the [[Blood Moon Ritual]] for unknown reasons. He is believed to have been monitoring [[Damien Timothy]]'s rise and may have tampered with sacred lycanthropic rites tied to the [[Lady of the Hunt]].
  
- **Borça**: During the downfall of [[Ivan Dilssnya]], certain noble families received anonymous letters advising cooperation with [[Ivana Boritsi]]. These letters contained knowledge that should not have been known—and their contents vanished in flame once read.

- **Falkovnia** *(rumored)*: The courtship between [[Patrina]] and [[Vladimir Drakov]] may have originated from an unknown sponsor. Some speculate Benedict orchestrated the match—or means to manipulate its fallout.

## 🎭 Modus Operandi

- **Never Seen, Always Felt** – Benedict does not operate in public. He influences by whisper, by written word, and by twisting rituals to his benefit.
- **Operates Through Others** – He has a growing network of cultists, politicians, and even adventurers under his sway—some willing, some unknowingly.
- **Temporal Expertise (Suspected)** – His predictions, interventions, and rituals suggest deep knowledge of time-altering magic, perhaps akin to what claimed **Felix** in [[Nova Vaasa]].

## 🧠 Personality Profile

Benedict appears calm, composed, and theatrically articulate—when he communicates at all. He often uses phrases referencing fate, balance, and “correction,” as though he sees the **Domains of Dread** as a system requiring subtle realignment.

He may consider himself a **fixer of broken timelines** or a **guardian of pattern**—or he may simply enjoy unraveling others’ plans from behind the veil.

## 🧩 Open Questions

- **Who does he serve?** Is he a mortal agent of the [[Dark Powers]]? A rogue [[Vestige]]? A lich? Or something older?
- **What does he want?** Some speculate he is building toward a specific convergence event—possibly tied to [[Azalin Rex]], [[Orcus]], or the collapse of the [[Mists]].
- **Why intervene in succession politics?** Benedict has shown repeated interest in installing or removing rulers—but not for wealth or loyalty. His goals are more abstract.
