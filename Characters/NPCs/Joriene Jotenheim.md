## 🧭 Overview

[[Joriene Jotenheim]] rose from the blood-soaked battlefields of [[Nova Vaasa]] as a legendary orc chieftain who united the scattered clans in defiance of the necromancer [[Zaanji Højplaads]]. For generations, the orcs had been hunted, enslaved, and resurrected as fodder in Zaanji's undead legions. Joriene changed that.

A tactical genius and charismatic leader, she led her people into open rebellion. When [[COUP]] arrived, it was Joriene who extended her hand—not in trust, but in mutual need. Together, they brought an end to Zaanji’s reign.

She now rules Nova Vaasa not as queen in a palace, but as warlord in a fractured realm, rebuilding her people’s culture and tending to a land that has only ever known death.

## 🛡️ Rule and Rebuilding

- **Warlord Leadership**: Joriene rules through strength, unity, and a warrior’s code. Her court is made of battle-scarred orcs and shamans, not nobles.
- **Spiritual Renewal**: She seeks to heal not just the land, but her people’s spirit—long broken by undeath and despair.
- **Resistance to Outside Influence**: Though allied with [[COUP]], she remains wary of foreign interference, determined to rebuild Nova Vaasa in the orcs' image.

## ⚔️ Relationship with COUP

- **Alliance by Fire**: Joriene forged a pact with COUP during their first assault on [[Kantora]], a bond sealed by blood, war, and tragedy.
- **Felix’s Death**: The party's first assault failed. [[Felix]], a warrior from [[Borça]], offered the last of his life to a time god, allowing COUP to try again. Joriene witnessed this selfless act and honored his memory in the orcish rites.
- **Victory and Aftermath**: With time reversed, COUP succeeded. Joriene took the throne, and the players received the **Boar’s Sin of Gluttony** as a boon.
