## 🧭 Overview

Count [[Strahd von Zarovich]] was the original Dreadlord of [[Barovia]]—a vampire tyrant, cursed by the [[Dark Powers]] after murdering his brother Sergei in a jealous rage. Obsessed with his unrequited love, Tatyana, and desperate to defy death, Strahd became both the jailer and prisoner of Barovia.

His rule spanned centuries, sustained by blood and fear. He manipulated the souls of the reborn, played god to his people, and treated adventurers like pawns in an endless cycle of torment.

But that cycle finally broke.

## ⚔️ Defeat and Aftermath

Five years ago, Strahd was slain by the adventuring party later known as the Heroes of Barovia:

- [[Issei Reinhardt]] – The half-elven warlock-paladin who struck the final blow, later crowned as Dreadlord of a liberated Barovia.
- [[Kastia]] – Catfolk Lore Bard and master of truth through story. She helped redeem [[Viktor Vallakovich]] and inspired the next generation of bards.
- [[Cora]] – A devastating Beastmaster Ranger who delivered massive damage throughout the battle.
- [[Po]] – A gentle elephantfolk cleric who kept the party alive and whole.
- [[Tal]] – A bugbear monk who moved unseen and struck decisively from the shadows.

Strahd’s death was not just a victory over a tyrant—it was a **turning point** for the **Domains of Dread**. The **Mists around Barovia began to lift**, unlocking travel to other lands and igniting the current crisis.

- **Vampiric Sovereignty** – Strahd could command the weather, dominate minds, and conjure swarms and wolves at will.
- **Dark Pact** – His power was granted by the Dark Powers in exchange for his soul and servitude.
- **Castle Ravenloft** – His domain and prison. A symbol of eternal tragedy and ambition.

- Folk whisper of his **return**, though no signs have emerged.
- His name is still invoked to frighten children—and to remind Barovians what they survived.
