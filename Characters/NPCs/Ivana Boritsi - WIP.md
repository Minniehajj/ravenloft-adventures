## 🧭 Overview

[[Ivana Boritsi]] is the eternal sovereign of [[Borça]] — a land of veiled daggers, perfumed poisons, and masked betrayals. Her rule is not one of overt tyranny, but of **expectation**, **appearance**, and **absolute consequence**. She wields her poisons like words, and her words like blades.

Once challenged by her rival and cousin **[[Ivan Dilssnya]]**, Ivana emerged victorious when [[COUP - Chaotic Opportunity Undertaking Personnel]] intervened during a period of civil unrest. Ivan’s drug empire crumbled beneath the party’s interference, and the aristocracy — weary of vulgarity — reaffirmed Ivana’s rule.

Her mansion, [[Misericordia]], is both palace and prison: a perfumed tomb of her own making, where every room is lined with lethal beauty. Ivana rarely leaves its halls, but her agents are everywhere.

## 🛠 Traits & Powers

- **Master Poisoner** – Her poisons can mimic illness, cloud minds, or induce euphoria before death. Many of Borça’s elite owe their deaths to her “tastings.”
- **Immortal Presence** – Ivana no longer ages and seems unaffected by disease or time. This is not due to undeath, but the Dark Powers' gift.
- **Absolute Control** – Her word is law in Borça, though rarely spoken aloud. Invitations from Ivana are mandates in all but name.
- **Tactician of Grace** – She does not strike first. But she always strikes last.

## 👤 Relationships

- **[[Ivan Dilssnya]]** – Her lecherous, drug-peddling cousin and former rival. Toppled by COUP. Dead or exiled; she does not speak of him.
- **[[COUP - Chaotic Opportunity Undertaking Personnel]]** – She permitted their passage and favored their choice to elevate her. Ivana rewarded their service with a boon of cunning.
- **[[Nuria Stratum]]** – A representative of the party who received her personal commendation and a lasting mark of favor.
- **The Aristocracy of Levkrest** – Utterly loyal or utterly dead. The nobility dances to her tune — sometimes literally.
- **[[The Dark Powers]]** – Her curse and benefactor. She rarely speaks of them but acknowledges their hand in her longevity.
