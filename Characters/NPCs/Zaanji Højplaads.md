## üß≠ Overview

[[Zaanji H√∏jplaads]] was the longtime **necromantic tyrant** of [[Nova Vaasa]], a domain plagued by civil war, famine, and unending death. Ruling from the capital city of [[Kantora]], he raised and commanded legions of the dead in a centuries-old campaign to **eradicate the orcish resistance** that defied his dominion.

Once a court wizard of a long-forgotten king, Zaanji turned on his sovereign and used forbidden rites to claim the throne. He transformed Nova Vaasa into a grim monument to undeath, where **life was a resource**, and the **dead were tools**.
