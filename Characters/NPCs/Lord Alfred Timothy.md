## üß≠ Overview

[[Lord Alfred Timothy]] ruled [[Verbrek]] not through politics or courtly intrigue, but through **dominance, instinct, and fear**. A powerful werewolf blessed‚Äîor cursed‚Äîby the divine wildness of [[The Lady of the Hunt]], Timothy saw himself as **Verbrek incarnate**: untamed, sacred, and brutal.

Under his rule, civilization decayed, and the strong preyed upon the weak. His word was law, his howl the summons of judgment. He embraced the **Blood Moon** as a spiritual symbol of dominance, culminating in his attempt to merge his essence with [[Fenrir]] and ascend to godhood.
