## ðŸŽ­ Background

Once a troubled youth dabbling in dangerous magics under the shadow of his father, the late [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]], Viktor Vallakovich's story could have ended in madness or tragedy. But after the fall of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], the original heroes of [[Barovia]] gave him a second chance.

Mentored by [[Kastia]], a catfolk [[College of Lore]] Bard of unmatched charisma and empathy, Viktor renounced his occultist practices and chose the path of redemption. He left behind his legacy of arcane arrogance and joined the [[Vistani]], embracing their oral traditions, songs, and stories.

Now, years later, he walks a new path â€” as both a chronicler and participant in the unfolding drama of the [[Domains of Dread]].
