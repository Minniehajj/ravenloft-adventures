## ☀️ Background

Nuria Stratum hatched in a Zhentarim safe-house beneath Dagger Falls, daughter of shadowed loyalty and tangled bloodlines. Her father died and her mother was imprisoned in a betrayal orchestrated by her uncle — a double agent for the ruling Cormaeril family. He took her and fled, raising her on the road far from the reach of the Zhentarim.

Wandering from caravan to caravan, Nuria grew up on survival, kindness, and campfire stories. When orcs ambushed their caravan near Neverwinter Wood, she alone survived, fleeing into the forest. There, grief-stricken and alone, she was found by monks of Selûne — adherents of the Order of the Sun Soul — who took her in.

Trained in radiant discipline, Nuria found peace in the Moonmaiden’s light. She learned to channel her ki into burning bolts of sunfire, blending fierce resolve with serenity. Though some monks whispered that she might be one of the rare “two-halved” Lizardfolk shamans — touched by both sides of the divine Kecuala — Nuria never sought a title. Only purpose.

That purpose led her to the [[Order of the Argent Dawn]], and from there to the Mists of [[Barovia]] and the fight against the forces of Azalin Rex. Her eyes are forward, her fists alight.
