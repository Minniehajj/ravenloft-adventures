## 🎭 Background

Zurolga Shinbasha was once a celebrated arena champion of [[Nova Vaasa]], hand-picked by the enigmatic [[Fight Queen]] to serve as a living vessel of the divine war god known only as [[WAAAGH!]]. She believes every battle is a form of prayer, every wound an offering, and every roar a hymn.

After aiding [[COUP]] in defending [[Kantora]] from a necrotic siege, Zurolga saw a greater purpose in their shared cause and joined them. Now, clad in [[Full Plate of Command +1]] and wielding the soul-hungry [[Mercurial Dragonslayer]], she spreads the gospel of glorious combat across the [[Domains of Dread]] — especially against the undead legions of [[Azalin Rex - WIP]].
