## 🧬 Background

Klingsklan Eldsbane is a silver-scaled Kobold whose small size belies his boundless rage and innate magical power. A creature of contrasts, Klingsklan is both beast and sorcerer, torn between primal fury and the refined might of his draconic bloodline.

Born under mysterious omens and empowered by draconic lineage, he channels the magic of silver dragons through sorcery, while his rage manifests in claws, fangs, and wild physical transformations. He believes power is meant to be used — loudly, explosively, and with glee. 

Though many underestimate him due to his size or origin, Klingsklan has proven to be a force of chaos and strength. His bond with [[Nuria Stratum]] is deep and genuine — forged in trials, solidified in battle. Together, they were drafted into the [[Order of the Argent Dawn]], where they rose to prominence as a strange but effective duo.
