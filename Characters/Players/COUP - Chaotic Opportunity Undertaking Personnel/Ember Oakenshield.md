## ðŸ”¥ Background

Ember Oakenshieldâ€™s story begins in the quiet, ancient woods south of [[Levkrest]], now charred by a miscast fireball. Her groveâ€™s dryad guardian spared her and tasked her with tracking the source of the destruction â€” a mission that led her to [[Barovia]] and the heart of the [[Domains of Dread]].

Over time, Ember's hunger for vengeance transformed into a fierce devotion to protecting the balance between life, death, and flame. Her wildfire spirit companion, **[[Arson]]**, burns alongside her â€” not as a weapon of rage, but as a symbol of rebirth.
