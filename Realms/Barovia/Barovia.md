## 🧭 Overview

Five years ago, Barovia was ruled with an iron grip by the vampire tyrant [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. His defeat at the hands of five adventurers shattered the cycle of despair that gripped the realm. In his place, [[Issei Reinhardt]]—a half-elven Warlock-Paladin and member of the victorious party—accepted the mantle of Dreadlord to protect Barovia from greater evils.

Under Issei’s rule, the mists surrounding Barovia have thinned, and a new gate was opened to the other Domains of Dread. Barovia has become a beacon of relative stability in the Shadowfell, a safe haven and central hub for those resisting the will of the [[Dark Powers]].

But not all is at peace. Old loyalties, haunted ruins, and undead remnants remain. Worse still, external threats from rival dreadlords like [[Azalin Rex - WIP]] loom, and the portal at Castle Ravenloft is a strategic prize in the war for dominion over Ravenloft itself.
