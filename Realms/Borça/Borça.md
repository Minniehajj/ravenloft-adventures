## 🧭 Overview

Borça is a land of elegance and venom — a place where civility masks cruelty, and every whispered compliment could carry lethal consequences. Under the reign of the immortal poisoner [[Ivana Boritsi - WIP]], Borça has become a domain of backhanded diplomacy, whispered scandal, and perfumes that kill.

The aristocracy plays at eternal masquerade, where etiquette and illusion matter more than substance. Death comes not from duels or battles, but from the sip of a glass or the slip of a word. In Borça, reputation is power, and trust is a fatal vulnerability.

While [[Ivana Boritsi - WIP]] remains the undisputed Dreadlord of the realm, her rule is increasingly passive, consumed by her private grief over her lost daughter, [[Natalia Vhorishkova]]. Her estate, [[Misericordia]], reflects that mourning — both grand and rotting at once.

## 🏙️ Notable Locations

- **[[Levkrest]]** – The capital city and heart of Borça’s high society. Parties and galas fill the calendar, but every event is also a political arena. Poisonings are masked as illness, and scandal is the favored weapon.
- **[[Misericordia]]** – Ivana Boritsi’s ancestral estate. A haunted, shifting manor where time bends and grief permeates the halls. The building responds to her emotional state, making it unstable and unpredictable to visitors.

## 🗡️ Recent Events (Campaign Context)

- [[COUP - Chaotic Opportunity Undertaking Personnel]] passed through Borça early in their journey and may have acquired gifts, curses, or information from Borcani contacts.
- Ivana’s power appears undiminished, but her interest in the outside world is waning, as she sinks further into melancholy over her daughter’s absence.
- The party has gained her attention, possibly due to Nuria’s connection to Borça and her possession of a blessing from Ivana herself (see: *Fox’s Sin of Cunning*).
