## 🧭 Overview

Falkovnia is a land under siege—both from within and without. For centuries, it has withstood nightly attacks by undead hordes, each wave more brutal and bizarre than the last. Meanwhile, its capital, Lekar, and surrounding cities fall deeper into authoritarian control under the iron grip of [[Vladimir Drakov]], a general-turned-tyrant who claims sole command over the war effort.

But not all battles are fought with blades. The rise of [[Patrina Vilkovna]]—a charismatic arcane reformer—has thrown the political landscape into chaos. Having defeated Drakov’s son, [[Mikhail Drakov]], in a sanctioned magical duel, she now controls the Ministry of the Arcane and is betrothed to Vladimir himself... though her true goal is assassination. The party has been drawn into this web of power as potential agents of her plot.
