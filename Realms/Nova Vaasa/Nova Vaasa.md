## 🧭 Overview

Nova Vaasa is a land scarred by centuries of warfare between the living and the dead.

For ages, the orcish tribes of the steppes fought a seemingly endless war against the necromantic empire of [[Zaanji Højplaads]]. Zaanji’s undead forces plagued the land, raised from countless battlefields and sacrificial altars. His capital, [[Kantora]], became a bastion of blighted magic and cruel dominion, sustained by grim rituals and ancient lichcraft.

The tide finally turned due to the sacrifice of [[Felix]], a warrior from [[Borça - WIP]]. Facing certain failure in their first assault on Zaanji’s forces, Felix gave up his remaining lifespan to a forgotten god of time. This sacrifice rewound fate, giving the adventuring party [[COUP]] the opportunity to correct their missteps and bring Zaanji down.

Now, [[Joriene Jotenheim]], a tribal war-priest and leader of the united orc clans, rules in Zaanji’s place. She does not wield magic, but she commands respect with brutal clarity and unwavering strength. The undead threat may have been broken—but peace in Nova Vaasa is far from certain.
