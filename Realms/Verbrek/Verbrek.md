## 🧭 Overview

Verbrek was once unified under the brutal fang and will of [[Lord Alfred Timothy]], a lycanthropic tyrant who ruled not by law but by primal instinct. Under his rule, civilization withered, and the strong preyed on the weak in a domain that worshipped the hunt.

When [[COUP]] slew Timothy in [[Arkan Vale]], his death ignited a crisis of leadership. No alpha has stepped forward with the strength or charisma to fill the void. Into this chaos returned [[Damien Timothy]], his estranged son—more thoughtful, more conflicted, and far less feared.

Verbrek is now a land divided: some yearn for a return to structure, while others embrace anarchy. The human settlements cling to survival, protected by the remnants of the [[Silvercloaks]]. Meanwhile, a strange new influence grows in the form of [[Lucy Bennett]]—a reincarnated girl from Faerûn with a history of espionage and a connection to Damien that’s become more than political.
