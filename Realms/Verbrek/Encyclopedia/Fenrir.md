## 🧭 Overview

**Fenrir** is a legendary divine werewolf—a spiritual avatar of the **Lady of the Hunt**. More myth than mortal, he represents the idealized form of lycanthropy: strength guided by purpose, not savagery. Stories say Fenrir once hunted beside the Lady herself in the ancient mists of Verbrek, defending the balance of the natural world.

To the faithful, Fenrir is more than a beast—he is the **test** by which leaders are judged and the **spirit** invoked during the **Blood Moon**.
