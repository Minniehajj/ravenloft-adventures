## 🧭 Overview

The **Lady of the Hunt** is a divine force revered in Verbrek as the patron of lycanthropes and primal hunters. She is not a Dark Power, but rather an elusive goddess who once walked in moonlight and shadow alike. Her will was law to those who ran with tooth and claw, and her blessing once legitimized the ancient rites of leadership among the werewolf clans.

Under the tyrannical rule of [[Lord Alfred Timothy]], her name was invoked in blood and fang. But when Timothy attempted to ascend to godhood during the [[Blood Moon Ritual]] by merging with the divine avatar **[[Fenrir]]**, the Lady **revoked her favor**.

## 🌕 Role in Verbrek

- **Spiritual Legitimacy**: In Verbrek, no true ruler is recognized by the old traditions without her favor.
- **The Hunt as Ritual**: Her rites are not simply about survival, but about balance—between beast and soul, rage and reason.
- **Withdrawal of Blessing**: When [[COUP]] disrupted Timothy’s ascension at [[Silverclaw Peak]], the Lady’s silence marked a turning point. No new alphas have received her divine approval since.
- **Cultural Vacuum**: Without her, Verbrek’s werewolf hierarchy has splintered. Many tribes await a sign… others have forsaken faith entirely.
